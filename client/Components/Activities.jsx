//FEATURE HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED --just a placeholder component for an activity random event generator
//If an event has been created but without an actual activity, a user should be able to enter
//random activities into a 'hat'--really just a list--and a function shoudl be able to spit out 
//a random activity for the group to do.
